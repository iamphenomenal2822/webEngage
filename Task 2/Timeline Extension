Subject: Request for Extension of Task Onsite Survey Deadline

Dear [Account Manager’s Name],

I am writing to inform you that due to an unforeseen family emergency, I will not be able to meet the original deadline for Onsite Survey that was set for tomorrow that is 23rd February, 2023. I am deeply sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

I am currently dealing with a personal situation that requires my immediate attention, and unfortunately, it has impacted my ability to complete the task as scheduled. However, I assure you that I will work diligently to finish the task as soon as possible.

I would like to request an extension of the deadline for Onsite Survey by 3 days. The new expected delivery date will be 26th Febrauary, 2023. This additional time will allow me to properly address the situation and complete the task to the best of my ability.

I appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this difficult time. Please let me know if this extension is feasible, or if there are any other solutions we can explore to ensure timely delivery of the task.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Shivam Swami.
